# basic_operations.py
# This script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers

# Define variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform calculations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print results in the required format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")

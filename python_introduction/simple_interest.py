# This script calculates the simple interest on a given principal amount

# Define variables
principal = 1000   # Initial investment
rate = 0.05        # Annual interest rate as a decimal
time = 3           # Investment period in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
